		<h3>Where I came from and what I've been up to:</h3>
		<p>I've trekked around this country quite a bit. I saw my first shooting star in a Texas sky, grew up in a haunted museum in New Orleans, took up for four years at an acting conservatory in North Carolina, started poetry shows in NYC, ran all the way out to California for a few epic sunsets and now I hang my hat in Baltimore, Maryland, a somewhat boarded-up Victorian city at the crossroads of growth and arrested development. I'm not a rover. I just want to see it all first hand. </p>

    	<p>If there's a puzzle to puzzle at, I'd like to think I'd piece it. I've been a  professional magician's assistant, a  ballroom dance teacher, a (terrible) waitress, an accomplished legal aid, a painter, an actress, an amature linguist, a poet, and a computer nerd. It may seem scattered at first glance, this list of endeavors, but you'd be pretty surprised at the kinds of binds you can get yourself out of with a well-rounded skill set. </p>

    	<p>I get hyped about old things and new technology. I will read anything that is put in front of me. For fun, I try to learn foreign languages and tinker with computers. I've had a poem published in a zombie anthology and I've recorded songs that ended up in a Japanese movie about an astronaut who fell in love with his ship. That pretty much sums it up, folks. Or, hell, maybe it's just a start...</p>
